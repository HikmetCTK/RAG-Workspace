## Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) for RAG 💡🎯
Behind the logic: In  RAG ,user question is searched in document and get chunks based on similarity score . Then We give these chunks with user question to llm and
LLM gives answer.

HyDE:First user question is asked to LLM and LLM's answer searched in documents then gets chunks based on LLM answer .Finally, Chunks and user question are given to llm.
LLM gives answer based on chunks.
