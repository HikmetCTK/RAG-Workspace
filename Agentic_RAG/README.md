## Agentic RAG: Unlocking Dynamic AI Applications...🚀 🚀 🚀 
Agentic RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) is a framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with information retrieval techniques to create AI systems which have dynamic decision-making.

This approach extends the capabilities of RAG systems by introducing agent-like behaviors, allowing the system to:

Make iterative retrievals based on previous outputs.

Use reasoning to select the best external data for generating accurate responses.

Execute tasks by interacting with APIs, databases, or other external systems.

## 🔍 How Does It Work?

Input Understanding: The user provides a query or task.

Dynamic Retrieval: The system retrieves information iteratively, fetching the most relevant data.

Reasoning and Planning: The model uses the retrieved data to plan actions or generate responses.

Action Execution: The system performs the required task or provides a refined response.
